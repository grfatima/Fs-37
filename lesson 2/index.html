    <h1>Snowman</h1>
    <p>
      A snowman is an anthropomorphic snow sculpture of a man often built in
      regions with sufficient snowfall and is a common winter tradition. In many
      places, typical snowmen consist of three large snowballs of different
      sizes with some additional accoutrements for facial and other features.
      Due to the sculptability of snow, there is also a wide variety of other
      styles. Common accessories include branches for arms and a smiley face
      made of stones, with a carrot used for a nose. Clothing, such as a hat or
      scarf, may be included.

      Snow becomes most suitable for packing when it approaches its melting
      point and becomes moist and compact. Making a snowman of powdered snow is
      difficult since it will not stick to itself, and if the temperature of
      packing snow drops, it will form an unusable denser form of powdered snow
      called the crust. Thus, a good time to build a snowman may be the next
      warm afternoon directly following a snowfall with a sufficient amount of
      snow. Using more compact snow allows for the construction of a large
      snowball by simply rolling it until it grows to the desired size. If the
      snowball reaches the bottom of the grass it may pick up traces of grass,
      gravel, or dirt.

      In North America, snowmen are generally built with three spheres
      representing the head, torso, and lower body.[1] In the United Kingdom,
      two spheres are used, one sphere representing the body and one
      representing the head. The usual practice is to then decorate and
      optionally dress the snowman. Sticks can be used for arms, and a face is
      traditionally made with stones or coal for eyes and a carrot for a nose.
      Some like to dress their snowmen in clothing such as a scarf or hat, while
      others prefer not to risk leaving supplies outdoors where they could
      easily be stolen or become stuck under melting ice. There are variations
      to these standard forms; for instance, the popular song "Frosty the
      Snowman" describes a snowman being decorated with a corncob pipe, button
      nose, coal eyes and an old silk hat (usually depicted as a top hat). These
      other types range from snow columns to elaborate snow sculptures similar
      to ice sculptures.
