    <h1 align="center">Tulips</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>Cultivation of the <i>tulip</i> began in Iran (Persia), probably in the 10th century. Early cultivars must have
        emerged from hybridisation in gardens from wild collected plants, which were then favoured, possibly due to
        flower size or growth vigour. The <i>tulip</i> is not mentioned by any writer from antiquity, therefore it seems
        probable that <i>tulips</i> were introduced into Anatolia only with the advance of the Seljuks.In the Ottoman
        Empire, numerous types of <i>tulips</i> were cultivated and bred,and today, 14 species can still be found in
        Turkey.<i>Tulips </i> are mentioned by <b>Omar Kayam and Jalal</b>.Species of <i>tulips</i> in Turkey typically
        come in red, less commonly in white or yellow.
        <b>
            <i>The Ottoman Turks had discovered that these wild tulips were great changelings, freely hybridizing
                (though it takes 7 years to show colour) but also subject to mutations that produced spontaneous changes
                in form and colour. </i>
